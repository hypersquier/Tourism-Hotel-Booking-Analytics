## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
- SQLite DB Browser (or any SQLite client)
- Power BI Desktop
- Dataset files downloaded from Kaggle

### Steps
1. Download the Hotel Booking and Airbnb datasets from Kaggle.
2. Import the datasets into a SQLite database (use SQLite DB Browser or scripts provided).
3. Run the provided SQL queries to clean, transform, and aggregate the data.
4. Connect Power BI Desktop to the SQLite database.
5. Import the Power BI report file (or recreate the report pages) and bind visuals to the prepared tables/measures.
6. Tune visuals, measures (DAX), and filters to match the dashboard pages.

## Where to put dashboard images
- Create a folder at: docs/images/
- Save the exported images with the recommended filenames:
  - docs/images/page1_performance_overview.png
  - docs/images/page2_pricing_strategy.png
  - docs/images/page3_customer_satisfaction.png
  - docs/images/page4_platform_comparison.png

Recommended export settings from Power BI:
- Format: PNG (preferred) or JPEG
- Resolution: 1400×800 px (16:9) or higher
- Compression: minimal to preserve text legibility
- Optional: export additional cropped images per section using filename patterns:
  - docs/images/page1_sectionA.png
  - docs/images/page2_sectionB.png

Update the README image links if you change filenames or paths.
